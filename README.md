# Optimal_Control_Project: Ball-and-Beam-system

The project involves studying various solution approaches in a classical Ball and Beam 
control system model. The system is inherently unstable without control but as long as it is 
controllable and observable the system can be stabilized. The Simulink model simulates a 
non-linear open loop response and a linearized Simulink model is generated to analyze the 
system. 

An optimal controller is designed using the (Linear Quadratic Regulator) LQR 
solution. Finally an observer is designed by pole positioning followed by an optimal observer 
that is coupled with the optimal controller. These various solutions are analyzed and 
compared to get an understanding of the problem. This problem is similar to many real 
world systems like stabilizing an aircraft during turbulence etc.
